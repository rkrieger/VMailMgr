# VmailMgr

Perl-based management tools and supporting library for manipulating [VMailMgr-style](http://vmailmgr.org/) virtual e-mail domains in Qmail.

## Goals

In short: minimisation of administrator pain for those still administering Qmail/VmailMgr backends.

* Feature-complete for hosting a large cluster of VmaiMgr virtual domains
* Remote control via a job queue
* Correct documentation
* Proper test coverage

## ToDo

At the time of writing, the ToDo list is as follows:

1. Transfer code from existing CVS repository
2. Finish VmailMgr library functions
3. Prepare test suite
4. Import to CPAN
 
## Questions, bugs, comments & feedback

These are more than welcome. If you can provide a test or patch, so much the better.

Please send these to <rkrieger@cpan.org>. I try to answer all e-mail, though it may occasionally take up to a week or two if I'm swamped with work. Patches (especially with a test I can include) tend to come first.
